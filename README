This repo contains a template IOC used to 
create a new IOC for a setra 5000 particle
counter with minimal effort. Unless you're 
working on SLAC's systems, this isn't of 
much use to you, since it's heavily tied 
to our setup. However, you can lift the 
relevant .db and .cmd files from this repo
for use in your own IOC. The branch `main`
still contains the original IOC which is 
more useful to the EPICS community at 
large.
